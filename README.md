Seeing Sound
------------

Dependencies
	- Kinect for Xbox (Kinect for Windows was not tested on)
	- Windows Computer
	- .NET 4.5
	- Kinect SDK v1.7.0

Running
	1) Attach a Kinect to the PC
	2) DoubleClick "SeeingSound.exe"
	3) Take a few steps back, away from the Kinect
	4) Move around within the range of the Kinect and speak

Note: The Kinect can only recognize up to 6 people at once. If you leave the viewing frame of the camera and then come back, you will be recognized as a different color since we have not implemented facial or body recognition.

The louder you speak, the larger the width of the lines will be. Each line will disapper after about 5 seconds
